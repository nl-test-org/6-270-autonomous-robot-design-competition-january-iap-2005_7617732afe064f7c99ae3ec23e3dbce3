The calendar below provides information on the lectures and workshops for this course. Each workshop is offered twice (A and B) to accommodate the number of teams in 6.270. The material covered in each of the two sessions is identical. Teams may sign up in advance for their preferred hour.

| SES # | TOPICS | KEY DATES |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | _Parts Sorting Session_  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Attendance at this session is mandatory: Each team must provide one person-hour of manual labor helping to sort out the kit parts. Usually this session is a lot of fun as you get to meet other people in the class and see all the goodies in your kit. |  |
| 2 | _Lecture 1 - Course Welcome_  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Attendance at this session is mandatory: Each team must have at least 50% of its members in attendance. In this session, we will go over the contest rules and organization of the class and hand out kits.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Workshop 1A - Basic Techniques of LEGO® Assembly_  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Bracing is a key element in keeping your robot together during the contest. Find out how to do it effectively and learn how you can use some of the more mysterious parts of your LEGO® kit.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Workshop 2A - Motor Mounting and LEGO® Gearboxes_  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Learn how to properly make a LEGO® gearbox that works smoothly and efficiently. Learn more about gear ratios, and how to connect your motors to your gearbox. | Assignment 1 out |
| 3 | _Lecture 1.5 (Optional) - Crash Course in C_  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Come to this lecture to learn and review the basics of C programming.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Workshop 1B - Basic Techniques of LEGO® Assembly_  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Bracing is a key element in keeping your robot together during the contest.

| 7 | _Workshop 5A - Servos, Sensors, and Shaft Encoders_  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Your robot cannot do anything useful without some knowledge of its external surroundings. Your robot will also need mechanisms for which it can navigate swiftly and accurately around the contest table. Learn how these parts in your robotics kit can help your robot move the way you want it to move. Find out which sensors work best for your robot's needs, and how to keep accurately track of how far or at which angle your robot has been moving. Also discuss how to use these unique parts in some more creative ways.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Workshop 6A - Advanced LEGO®_  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Every year many of the more unique pieces of your LEGO® kit are left unexplored and unused. Learn some interesting applications of your stranger LEGO® pieces, and how they can help your robot do task-specific motions.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Workshop 7A - Code II: Advanced Techniques_  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}The code for your robot plays a crucial role in your robot's ability to win. Learn the value of good coding practices by observing robots with identical hardware trying to do the same task in different ways. Learn about error recovery techniques and how to achieve robustness in your code and strategy. | Assignment 4 out  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Assignment 3 due |
